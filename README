NOTE:  This is an older version of Python kcorrect.

See the information about the tool here:

http://howdy.physics.nyu.edu/index.php/Kcorrect

This is a Python version of what the IDL version offers!


Installation
------------

This version of KCorrect requires the following software to be already
installed on your machine:

  -- Python 2.6.2 or better (http://www.python.org/)
  -- NumPy 1.4.1 or better (http://www.scipy.org/Download/)
  -- SWIG 2.0.4 or better (http://www.swig.org/)

(I should mention these are the versions of software used to test the
code.)

After making sure the above software are installed properly, simply
do:

  $ python setup.py build_ext
  $ sudo python setup.py install

to install KCorrect in the Python's system-wide site-packages
directory.  

If you wish to install KCorrect in some other local directory (because
you cannot become root, for example), do

  $ python setup.py install --prefix=~

to install KCorrect in ~/lib/python2.6/site-packages.  Note in this
case that the path

  ~/lib/python2.6/site-packages

needs to be added to PYTHONPATH environment variable for Python to
find the package.


SWIG Version
------------ 

This version of kcorrect may have a compilation issue with SWIG 1.3.
The symptom is that the program segfauts at certain points during
running.

If your system does not have the required version of SWIG installed,
you can instruct distutils to use another version of SWIG manually
installed under a non-system directory.  For example,

  $ python setup.py build_ext --swig=/usr/local/bin/swig

will use the version of SWIG installed under /usr/local.
